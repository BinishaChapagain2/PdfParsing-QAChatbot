      "\n",
      "A few years ago, system control functions were implemented using logic components and were usually large, heavy boxes. Later on, microprocessors were used and the entire con- troller could fit onto a small circuit board. As the process of miniaturization continued, all of the components needed for a controller were built right onto one chip. By only including the fea- tures specific to the task, cost is relatively low.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical microcontroller has bit manipulation instructions, easy7 and direct access to I/O, and quick and efficient interrupt processing. Therefore, a microcontroller is a highly integrated device which includes, on one chip, all or most of the parts needed to perform an application control function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microcontrollers come in many varieties. Depending on the power and features that are needed, customers might choose a 4, 8, 16, or 32 bit microcontroller.\n",

      "The I2C bus is a simple 2 wire serial interface developed by Philips. It was developed for 8 bit applications and is widely used in consumer electronics, automotive and industrial applica- tions. In addition to microcontrollers, several peripherals also exist that support the I2C bus. The I2C bus is a two line, multi-master, multi-slave network interface with collision detection. Up to 128 devices can exist on the network and they can be spread out over 10 meters. Each node (microcontroller or peripheral) may initiate a message, and then transmit or receive data. The two lines of the network consist of the serial data line and the serial clock line. Each node on the network has a unique address which accompanies any message passed between nodes. Since only 2 wires are needed, it is easy to interconnect a number of devices.\n",

      "Polling. Polling is what you have to do if your microcontroller does not have interrupts or if what you want to do is not time critical. It is a software technique whereby the controller con- tinually asks a peripheral if it needs servicing. The peripheral sets a flag when it has data ready for transferring to the controller, which the controller notices on its next poll. Several pe- ripherals can be polled in succession, with the controller jumping to different software routines, depending on which flags have been set.\n",

      "Interrupts. Rather than have the microcontroller continually polling - that is, asking periph- erals (timers / UARTS / A/Ds / external components) whether they have any data available (and finding most of the time they do not), a more efficient method is to have the peripherals tell the controller when they have data ready. The controller can be carrying out its normal function, only responding to peripherals when there is data to respond to. On receipt of an in- terrupt, the controller suspends its current operation, identifies the interrupting peripheral, then jumps to the appropriate interrupt service routine. The advantage of interrupts, compared with polling, is the speed of response to external events and reduced software overhead (of con- tinually asking peripherals if they have any data ready).\n",
      "\n",
      "Most microcontrollers have at least one external interrupt, which can be edge selectable (rising or falling) or level triggered. Both systems have advantages. Edge is not time sensitive, but it is susceptible to glitches. Level must be held high (or low) for a specific duration (which can be a pain but is not susceptible to glitches).\n",

      "\n",
      "Since automotive applications have been the driving force behind most microcontrollers, and 5 Volts was very easy to do in a car, most microcontrollers only supported 4.5 - 5.5 V opera- tion. In the recent past, as consumer goods were beginning to drive major segments of the mi- crocontroller market, and became portable and lightweight, the requirement for 3 volt (and lower) microcontrollers became urgent. 3 volts means 2 battery solution, lower voltage and longer battery life. Most low voltage parts in the market today are simply 5 volt parts that were modified to operate at 3 volts (usually at a performance loss). Some micros being released now are designed from the ground up to operate properly at 3.0 (and lower) voltages, which offer a performance level comparable to 5 volt devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why are voltages going down on ICs? There are a few interesting rules of thumb regarding transistors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The amount of power they dissipate is proportional to their size. If you make a transistor half as big, it dissipates half as much power.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Their propagation delay is proportional to their size. If you make a transistor half as big, it’s twice as fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Their cost is proportional to the square of their size. If you make them half as big, they cost one quarter as much.\n",

How- ever, now that the transistors are getting so small, 5 Volts would now destroy them. The only way around this is to start lowering the voltage. This is also why people are now using 3 (ac- tually 3.3) Volt logic, and this will certainly lead to lower voltages in the next few years.\n",

Up to 128 devices can exist on the network and they can be spread out over 10 meters. Each node (microcontroller or peripheral) may initiate a message, and then transmit or receive data. The two lines of the network consist of the serial data line and the serial clock line. Each node on the network has a unique address which accompanies any message passed between nodes.

Rather than have the microcontroller continually polling - that is, asking periph- erals (timers / UARTS / A/Ds / external components) whether they have any data available (and finding most of the time they do not), a more efficient method is to have the peripherals tell the controller when they have data ready. The controller can be carrying out its normal function, only responding to peripherals when there is data to respond to. On receipt of an in- terrupt, the controller suspends its current operation, identifies the interrupting peripheral, then jumps to the appropriate interrupt service routine. The advantage of interrupts, compared with polling, is the speed of response to external events and reduced software overhead (of con- tinually asking peripherals if they have any data ready).\n",

      "Most microcontrollers have at least one external interrupt, which can be edge selectable (rising or falling) or level triggered. Both systems have advantages. Edge is not time sensitive, but it is susceptible to glitches. Level must be held high (or low) for a specific duration (which can be a pain but is not susceptible to glitches).\n",

      "Since automotive applications have been the driving force behind most microcontrollers, and 5 Volts was very easy to do in a car, most microcontrollers only supported 4.5 - 5.5 V opera- tion. In the recent past, as consumer goods were beginning to drive major segments of the mi- crocontroller market, and became portable and lightweight, the requirement for 3 volt (and lower) microcontrollers became urgent. 3 volts means 2 battery solution, lower voltage and longer battery life. Most low voltage parts in the market today are simply 5 volt parts that were modified to operate at 3 volts (usually at a performance loss). Some micros being released now are designed from the ground up to operate properly at 3.0 (and lower) voltages, which offer a performance level comparable to 5 volt devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why are voltages going down on ICs? There are a few interesting rules of thumb regarding transistors:\n",

      "\n",
      "Parent Chunk 25:\n",
      "1) The amount of power they dissipate is proportional to their size. If you make a transistor half as big, it dissipates half as much power.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Their propagation delay is proportional to their size. If you make a transistor half as big, it’s twice as fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Their cost is proportional to the square of their size. If you make them half as big, they cost one quarter as much.\n",

      "For years people have been using 5 Volts to power integrated circuits. Because the transistors were large, there was little danger damaging the transistor putting this voltage across it. How- ever, now that the transistors are getting so small, 5 Volts would now destroy them. The only way around this is to start lowering the voltage. This is also why people are now using 3 (ac- tually 3.3) Volt logic, and this will certainly lead to lower voltages in the next few years.\n",
